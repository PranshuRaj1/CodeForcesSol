## About

In this repository, you will find my solutions to a wide range of competitive programming problems. Each problem solution is organized into its own directory, often categorized by the online judge and topic. The solutions are primarily written in C++ and Java, but I may use other languages occasionally.

Feel free to explore, learn from, and use these solutions for your own practice and reference. Additionally, you're welcome to contribute to this repository by submitting improvements, new solutions, or correcting any errors you find.
